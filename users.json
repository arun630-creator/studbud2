This plan is structured to be rigorous but also adaptable to your specific needs and the requirements of your course.  Remember that consistency and mindful adjustments are key to success.\n\n**I. Guiding Principles & Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Subject Focus:** This plan is designed specifically for a general \"History\" course.  If you have a specific historical period, region, or theme, you'll need to adjust the daily and weekly focuses accordingly.\n*   **High Intensity, Planned Breaks:**  We're aiming for focused study, but avoiding burnout.  Short, regular breaks and longer, strategic breaks are crucial.\n*   **Active Learning:**  This isn't about passively reading.  It's about engaging with the material, questioning, analyzing, and synthesizing.\n*   **Flexibility:**  Life happens. Build in some wiggle room. This is a *plan*, not an unbreakable law.  If you fall behind, don't panic \u2013 adjust the subsequent days and weeks.\n*   **Prioritize Sleep & Well-being:** Even with 12 hours, you MUST get adequate sleep (7-8 hours).  Proper rest is crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function.  Also, incorporate short exercise breaks (even a quick walk).\n\n**II.
